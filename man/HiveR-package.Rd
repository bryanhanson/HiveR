\title{2D and 3D Hive Plots for R}
\description{
Creates and plots 2D and 3D hive plots. Hive plots are a unique method of
displaying networks of many types in which node properties are mapped to
axes using meaningful properties rather than being arbitrarily positioned.
The hive plot concept was invented by Martin Krzywinski at the Genome
Science Center (www.hiveplot.net/).  Keywords: networks, food webs, linnet,
systems biology, bioinformatics.
