\title{Summarize a Hive Plot Data Object and Optionally Run Some Checks}
\usage{
sumHPD(HPD, chk.all = FALSE, chk.sm.pt = FALSE, chk.ax.jump = FALSE,
  chk.sm.ax = FALSE, chk.orphan.node = FALSE,
  chk.virtual.edge = FALSE, plot.list = FALSE, tex = FALSE,
  orphan.list = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{HPD}{An object of S3 class \code{HivePlotData}.}

\item{chk.all}{Logical; should all the checks below be run?  See Details.}

\item{chk.sm.pt}{Logical; should the edges be checked to see if any of them
start and end on the same axis with the same radius?  See Details.}

\item{chk.ax.jump}{Logical; should the edges be checked to see if any of
them start and end on non-adjacent axes, e.g. axis 1 --> axis 3?  See
Details.}

\item{chk.sm.ax}{Logical; should the edges be checked to see if any of them
start and end on the same axis?}

\item{chk.orphan.node}{Logical; should orphan nodes be identifed?  Orphan
nodes have degree 0 (no incoming or outgoing edges).}

\item{chk.virtual.edge}{Logical; should the edges be checked to see if any of them
start and end on different nodes which happen to be at the same radius on the
same axis? See Details.}

\item{plot.list}{Logical; should a data frame of edges to be drawn be
returned?}

\item{tex}{Logical; should the \code{plot.list} be formatted for LaTeX?}

\item{orphan.list}{Logical; should a data frame of orphaned nodes be
returned?}
}
\value{
A summary of the \code{HivePlotData} object's key characteristics is
printed at the console, followed by the results of any checks set to
\code{TRUE}.  The format of these results is identical to that of
\code{plot.list} described just below, except for the orphan node check.
This is formatted the same as \code{HPD$nodes}; see \code{?HPD} for details.

If \code{plot.list = TRUE}, a data frame containing a list of the
edges to be drawn in a format suitable for troubleshooting a plot.  If
\code{tex = TRUE} as well, the data frame will be in a format suitable for
pasting into a LaTeX document.  The data frame will contain rows describing
each edge to be drawn with the following columns: node 1 id, node 1 axis,
node 1 label, node 1 radius, then the same info for node 2, then the edge
weight and the edge color.

If \code{orphan.list = TRUE} a data frame
giving the orphan nodes is returned.  If you want both \code{plot.list} and
\code{orphan.list} you have to call this function twice.
}
\description{
This function summarizes a \code{\link{HivePlotData}} object in a convenient
form. Optionally, it can run some checks for certain conditions that may be
of interest.  It can also output a summary of edges to be drawn, either as a
data frame or in a LaTeX ready form, or a data frame of orphaned nodes.

\details{
Argument \code{chk.sm.pt} applies only to hive plots of \code{type = 2D}.
It checks to see if any of the edges start and end at the same node id.
These by definition exist at the same radius on the same axis, which
causes an error in \code{plotHive} since you are trying to draw an edge of
length zero (the actual error message is \code{Error in calcCurveGrob(x,
x$debug) : End points must not be identical}.  Some data sets may have such
cases intrinsically or due to data entry error, or the condition may arise
during processing.  Either way, one needs to be able to detect such cases
for removal or modification. This argument will tell you which nodes cause
the problem.

Argument \code{chk.virtual.edge} applies only to hive plots of \code{type = 2D}
and is similiar to \code{chk.sm.pt} above except
that it checks for virtual edges.  These are edges start and end on the
same axis at the same radius but at different node id's (in other words,
two nodes have the same radius on the same axis).  This condition
gives the same error as above.  It is checked for separately as it arises
via a different problem in the construction of the data.

Argument \code{chk.ax.jump} applies only to hive plots
of \code{type = 2D}.  It checks to see if any of the edges jump an axis,
e.g. axis 1 --> axis 3. This argument will tell you which nodes are at
either end of the jumping edge.  Jumping should should be avoided in hive
plots as it makes the plot aesthetically unpleasing.  However, depending
upon how you process the data, this condition may arise and hence it is
useful to be able to locate jumps.
